See [here for instructions](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot#step-2-nominate-a-validator) on how to nominate. There is also a nice [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCXC0CDhyS4).


{{< hint type=important >}}
Since inception, **both validators had zero faults**: no slashing, no chilling, no errors in the 1kv programme.

{{< hint type=tip >}}
You can nominate more than one validator with your funds. The validators that get selected each round (called an era) are determined by a special election protocol (called [Phragm√©n](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-phragmen)) that aims to get a fair and balanced allocation. So, even if you already staked your funds with another validator, you can still select our validator(s) in addition (up to a maximum of 16).
