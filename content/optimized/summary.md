Based on our [detailed analysis](analysis-0-9-26), we have compiled polkadot version 0.9.26 with the following optimization options
```Shell
rustup override set nightly
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -C codegen=1"
cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --locked -Z unstable-options
```
In the table below, the benchmark scores are listed for a few machines with different CPU architectures. As explained in our [detailed analysis](analysis-0-9-26), we only focus on CPU scores and took the median value over 20 runs.

If you want to contribute to this list:
- You first have to [compile polkadot yourself](/optimized/compile) using the options above for your machine. 
- Then you run [our benchmark script](https://github.com/MathCryptoDoc/polkadot-optimized) when there are *no other resource hungry tasks running*.
- Finally, send us the ``feather`` file generated by the parse script.
